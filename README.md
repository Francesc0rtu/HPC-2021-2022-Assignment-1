# HPC-course-2021-2022

This repository contain the assignment 1 for the course `Foundations of High Performance Computing` @ DSSC- University of Trieste, that I attended during the second semester of 2021.

The core of the assignment was to analyze an HPC facility and to study scalability and network performance of parallel programs (MPI & OpenMP). 

The following link leads to the official repository of the course, where it is possible to find the instruction of the task:
